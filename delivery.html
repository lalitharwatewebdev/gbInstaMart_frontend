        <h2>TERMS OF SHIPPING AND DELIVERY</h2>
        <p>
            3.1 To ensure the safe and timely delivery of Products to you, we work with trusted third-party logistics service providers ("Logistics Partners"). At the moment a Product is processed and successfully turned over to a Logistics Partner, we will send the information of the Logistics Partner who will be responsible for handling the shipment and delivery of such Product(s). Products ordered on GROWBIG SUPERMARTS LIMITED are typically sent out within 5 to 7 businessdays (depending on location).

We will also notify you via the e-mail address and/or cellphone number you have provided/registered with us as soon as your items have been sent. You acknowledge that we may, at our sole discretion, ship and deliver Products to Users without using any Logistics Partners or other third-party service providers, even if we normally do so via these partners. You acknowledge and accept that although we make every effort to ship and deliver our Products across India, we reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to identify some locations as being inaccessible at any given moment. In the event that you are placing an order from an unserviceable region, we or our Logistics Partners may be unable to fulfil it. If a user attempts to place an order for Products on the Website from a location that we have determined to be unserviceable, we will inform them at the time of order placement. You may also use GROWBIG SUPERMARTS LIMITED to see whether we don't deliver to a certain location by entering the local PIN code.
        </p>
        <p>
            3.2 You understand and agree that we may ask for or collect information that helps us deliver the Products you've ordered to you, like your name, shipping address, billing address, location, contact details, etc. All information you provide to us on the Website must be correct, up-to-date, and adequate for us to determine the correct destination for delivery. You agree to take full responsibility for any delay or failure on our part to deliver the Products you've ordered if such delay or failure is attributable to your failure to supply us with correct, complete, adequate, and accurate information when making the order. We also make it clear that if you don't provide us with the information, we need to deliver the products successfully; we won't be responsible in any way or at any time.
        </p>
        <p>
            3.3 We will make every effort to ship your ordered Product to the address you provide within the delivery window you've been given. No more than three (3) efforts will be made by our Logistics Partners to deliver the bought Product(s) to you if you are not present to accept delivery. We retain the right to cancel the order of the acquired Products at our sole discretion if the third delivery attempt is unsuccessful and you continue to be unreachable. If you cancel your order and get a refund, we retain the right to withhold the cost of shipping and handling from your total refund amount.

            <li>(b) Unfavorable meteorological circumstances;</li>

        </p>
        <p>
            3.6 We expect our Logistics Partners, employees, and agents to uphold the highest standards of ethics and integrity and to conduct themselves in a way that demonstrates a high level of professionalism, expertise, and good manners.

We will make every effort to get the Products delivered to you as soon as possible, and our operations and support teams will work with the Logistics Partners to update the tracking status of the Products you've ordered in real-time.

        </p>
